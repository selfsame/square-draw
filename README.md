# square-draw

A simple web design application that lets you draw rectangles on an html canvas, then select, reposition, and resize them.

## concepts

* A renderer that builds a visual document from said file
* application state (tool choice, input lifecycle events)
* element picking (what's under the mouse)
* element selection, modification, resize handles
